"Adds support for authentication by LDAP server.\n"
"===============================================\n"
"This module allows users to login with their LDAP username and password, "
"and\n"
"will automatically create OpenERP users for them on the fly.\n"
"\n"
"**Note:** This module only work on servers who have Python's ``ldap`` module "
"installed.\n"
"\n"
"Configuration:\n"
"--------------\n"
"After installing this module, you need to configure the LDAP parameters in "
"the\n"
"Configuration tab of the Company details. Different companies may have "
"different\n"
"LDAP servers, as long as they have unique usernames (usernames need to be "
"unique\n"
"in OpenERP, even across multiple companies).\n"
"\n"
"Anonymous LDAP binding is also supported (for LDAP servers that allow it), "
"by\n"
"simply keeping the LDAP user and password empty in the LDAP configuration.\n"
"This does not allow anonymous authentication for users, it is only for the "
"master\n"
"LDAP account that is used to verify if a user exists before attempting to\n"
"authenticate it.\n"
"\n"
"Securing the connection with STARTTLS is available for LDAP servers "
"supporting\n"
"it, by enabling the TLS option in the LDAP configuration.\n"
"\n"
"For further options configuring the LDAP settings, refer to the ldap.conf\n"
"manpage: manpage:`ldap.conf(5)`.\n"
"\n"
"Security Considerations:\n"
"------------------------\n"
"Users' LDAP passwords are never stored in the OpenERP database, the LDAP "
"server\n"
"is queried whenever a user needs to be authenticated. No duplication of the\n"
"password occurs, and passwords are managed in one place only.\n"
"\n"
"OpenERP does not manage password changes in the LDAP, so any change of "
"password\n"
"should be conducted by other means in the LDAP directory directly (for LDAP "
"users).\n"
"\n"
"It is also possible to have local OpenERP users in the database along with\n"

"    * The system first attempts to authenticate users against the local "

"    * if this authentication fails (for example because the user has no "

"         usually do not want this. One easy way to setup a template user is "
"to\n"
"         login once with a valid LDAP user, let OpenERP create a blank "
"local\n"
"         user with the same login (and a blank password), then rename this "

"         user to a username that does not exist in LDAP, and setup its "

"Adds support for authentication by LDAP server.\n"
"===============================================\n"
"This module allows users to login with their LDAP username and password, "
"and\n"
"will automatically create OpenERP users for them on the fly.\n"
"\n"
"**Note:** This module only work on servers who have Python's ``ldap`` module "
"installed.\n"
"\n"
"Configuration:\n"
"--------------\n"
"After installing this module, you need to configure the LDAP parameters in "
"the\n"
"Configuration tab of the Company details. Different companies may have "
"different\n"
"LDAP servers, as long as they have unique usernames (usernames need to be "
"unique\n"
"in OpenERP, even across multiple companies).\n"
"\n"
"Anonymous LDAP binding is also supported (for LDAP servers that allow it), "
"by\n"
"simply keeping the LDAP user and password empty in the LDAP configuration.\n"
"This does not allow anonymous authentication for users, it is only for the "
"master\n"
"LDAP account that is used to verify if a user exists before attempting to\n"
"authenticate it.\n"
"\n"
"Securing the connection with STARTTLS is available for LDAP servers "
"supporting\n"
"it, by enabling the TLS option in the LDAP configuration.\n"
"\n"
"For further options configuring the LDAP settings, refer to the ldap.conf\n"
"manpage: manpage:`ldap.conf(5)`.\n"
"\n"
"Security Considerations:\n"
"------------------------\n"
"Users' LDAP passwords are never stored in the OpenERP database, the LDAP "
"server\n"
"is queried whenever a user needs to be authenticated. No duplication of the\n"
"password occurs, and passwords are managed in one place only.\n"
"\n"
"OpenERP does not manage password changes in the LDAP, so any change of "
"password\n"
"should be conducted by other means in the LDAP directory directly (for LDAP "
"users).\n"
"\n"
"It is also possible to have local OpenERP users in the database along with\n"
"LDAP-authenticated users (the Administrator account is one obvious "
"example).\n"
"\n"
"Here is how it works:\n"
"---------------------\n"
"    * The system first attempts to authenticate users against the local "
"OpenERP\n"

"    * if this authentication fails (for example because the user has no "
