"\n"
"The module structure and some code is inspired by the report_openoffice module.\n"
"\n"
"The module allows:\n"
"------------------\n"
"    - HTML report definition\n"
"    - Multi header support\n"
"    - Multi logo\n"
"    - Multi company support\n"
"    - HTML and CSS-3 support (In the limit of the actual WebKIT version)\n"
"    - JavaScript support\n"
"    - Raw HTML debugger\n"
"    - Book printing capabilities\n"
"    - Margins definition\n"
"    - Paper size definition\n"

"Requirements and Installation:\n"
"------------------------------\n"
"This module requires the ``wkhtmltopdf`` library to render HTML documents as\n"
"PDF. Version 0.9.9 or later is necessary, and can be found at\n"
"http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/ for Linux, Mac OS X (i386) and Windows (32bits).\n"

"will be validated using the Belgian rules.\n"
"\n"
"There are two different levels of VAT number validation:\n"
"--------------------------------------------------------\n"
"    * By default, a simple off-line check is performed using the known validation\n"
"      rules for the country, usually a simple check digit. This is quick and \n"
"      always available, but allows numbers that are perhaps not truly allocated,\n"
"      or not valid anymore.\n"
"      \n"
"    * When the \"VAT VIES Check\" option is enabled (in the configuration of the user's\n"
"      Company), VAT numbers will be instead submitted to the online EU VIES\n"
"      database, which will truly verify that the number is valid and currently\n"
"      allocated to a EU company. This is a little bit slower than the simple\n"
"      off-line check, requires an Internet connection, and may not be available\n"
"      all the time. If the service is not available or does not support the\n"
"      requested country (e.g. for non-EU countries), a simple check will be performed\n"
"      instead.\n"

msgid "Adds support for authentication by LDAP server.\n"
"===============================================\n"
"This module allows users to login with their LDAP username and password, and\n"
"will automatically create OpenERP users for them on the fly.\n"
"\n"
"**Note:** This module only work on servers who have Python's ``ldap`` module installed.\n"
"\n"
"Configuration:\n"
"--------------\n"
"After installing this module, you need to configure the LDAP parameters in the\n"
"Configuration tab of the Company details. Different companies may have different\n"
"LDAP servers, as long as they have unique usernames (usernames need to be unique\n"
"in OpenERP, even across multiple companies).\n"
"\n"
"Anonymous LDAP binding is also supported (for LDAP servers that allow it), by\n"
"simply keeping the LDAP user and password empty in the LDAP configuration.\n"
"This does not allow anonymous authentication for users, it is only for the master\n"
"LDAP account that is used to verify if a user exists before attempting to\n"
"authenticate it.\n"
"\n"
"Securing the connection with STARTTLS is available for LDAP servers supporting\n"
"it, by enabling the TLS option in the LDAP configuration.\n"
"\n"
"For further options configuring the LDAP settings, refer to the ldap.conf\n"
"manpage: manpage:`ldap.conf(5)`.\n"
"\n"
"Security Considerations:\n"
"------------------------\n"
"Users' LDAP passwords are never stored in the OpenERP database, the LDAP server\n"
"is queried whenever a user needs to be authenticated. No duplication of the\n"
"password occurs, and passwords are managed in one place only.\n"
"\n"
"OpenERP does not manage password changes in the LDAP, so any change of password\n"
"should be conducted by other means in the LDAP directory directly (for LDAP users).\n"
"\n"
"It is also possible to have local OpenERP users in the database along with\n"
"LDAP-authenticated users (the Administrator account is one obvious example).\n"
"\n"
"Here is how it works:\n"
"---------------------\n"
"    * The system first attempts to authenticate users against the local OpenERP\n"
"      database;\n"
"    * if this authentication fails (for example because the user has no local\n"
"      password), the system then attempts to authenticate against LDAP;\n"
"\n"
"As LDAP users have blank passwords by default in the local OpenERP database\n"
"(which means no access), the first step always fails and the LDAP server is\n"
"queried to do the authentication.\n"
"\n"
"Enabling STARTTLS ensures that the authentication query to the LDAP server is\n"
"encrypted.\n"
"\n"
"User Template:\n"
"--------------\n"
"In the LDAP configuration on the Company form, it is possible to select a *User\n"
"Template*. If set, this user will be used as template to create the local users\n"
"whenever someone authenticates for the first time via LDAP authentication. This\n"
"allows pre-setting the default groups and menus of the first-time users.\n"
"\n"
"**Warning:** if you set a password for the user template, this password will be\n"
"         assigned as local password for each new LDAP user, effectively setting\n"
"         a *master password* for these users (until manually changed). You\n"

msgstr "Adds support for authentication by LDAP server.\n"
"===============================================\n"
"This module allows users to login with their LDAP username and password, and\n"
"will automatically create OpenERP users for them on the fly.\n"
"\n"
"**Note:** This module only work on servers who have Python's ``ldap`` module installed.\n"
"\n"
"Configuration:\n"
"--------------\n"
"After installing this module, you need to configure the LDAP parameters in the\n"
"Configuration tab of the Company details. Different companies may have different\n"
"LDAP servers, as long as they have unique usernames (usernames need to be unique\n"
"in OpenERP, even across multiple companies).\n"
"\n"
"Anonymous LDAP binding is also supported (for LDAP servers that allow it), by\n"
"simply keeping the LDAP user and password empty in the LDAP configuration.\n"
"This does not allow anonymous authentication for users, it is only for the master\n"
"LDAP account that is used to verify if a user exists before attempting to\n"
"authenticate it.\n"
"\n"
"Securing the connection with STARTTLS is available for LDAP servers supporting\n"
"it, by enabling the TLS option in the LDAP configuration.\n"
"\n"
"For further options configuring the LDAP settings, refer to the ldap.conf\n"
"manpage: manpage:`ldap.conf(5)`.\n"
"\n"
"Security Considerations:\n"
"------------------------\n"
"Users' LDAP passwords are never stored in the OpenERP database, the LDAP server\n"
"is queried whenever a user needs to be authenticated. No duplication of the\n"
"password occurs, and passwords are managed in one place only.\n"
"\n"
"OpenERP does not manage password changes in the LDAP, so any change of password\n"
"should be conducted by other means in the LDAP directory directly (for LDAP users).\n"
"\n"
"It is also possible to have local OpenERP users in the database along with\n"
"LDAP-authenticated users (the Administrator account is one obvious example).\n"
"\n"
"Here is how it works:\n"
"---------------------\n"
"    * The system first attempts to authenticate users against the local OpenERP\n"
"      database;\n"
"    * if this authentication fails (for example because the user has no local\n"
"      password), the system then attempts to authenticate against LDAP;\n"
"\n"
"As LDAP users have blank passwords by default in the local OpenERP database\n"
"(which means no access), the first step always fails and the LDAP server is\n"
"queried to do the authentication.\n"
"\n"
"Enabling STARTTLS ensures that the authentication query to the LDAP server is\n"
"encrypted.\n"
"\n"
"User Template:\n"
"--------------\n"
"In the LDAP configuration on the Company form, it is possible to select a *User\n"
"Template*. If set, this user will be used as template to create the local users\n"
"whenever someone authenticates for the first time via LDAP authentication. This\n"
"allows pre-setting the default groups and menus of the first-time users.\n"
"\n"
"**Warning:** if you set a password for the user template, this password will be\n"
"         assigned as local password for each new LDAP user, effectively setting\n"
"         a *master password* for these users (until manually changed). You\n"
"         usually do not want this. One easy way to setup a template user is to\n"
"         login once with a valid LDAP user, let OpenERP create a blank local\n"
"         user with the same login (and a blank password), then rename this new\n"
"         user to a username that does not exist in LDAP, and setup its groups\n"
